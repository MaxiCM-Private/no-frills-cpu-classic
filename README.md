#Â No-frills CPU Control CLASSIC

No-frills CPU Control CLASSIC is a trimmed down version of the popular [No-frills CPU Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.sineo.android.noFrillsCPU) Android app. It is meant for older devices running Android 1.6 "Donut" or Android 2.0 "Eclair" or for people who want an app as small as possible: just around 400KB!

All the features of the standard [No-frills CPU Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.sineo.android.noFrillsCPU) are available in the CLASSIC version. The **only difference** lies in the user interface ("the looks"), as the new Android 4.0+ look is not compatible with devices runing Android 1.6 or 2.0.

For further information, check the standard app.
